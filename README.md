## Workflows

Upon merging to `main` a workflow will automatically update the module in `viam-dev` allowing for people to use your latest changes. This is done using API_KEY and API_KEY_ID that belon to the `viam-dev` environment. They are stored as github secrets in this module but can be found by going to `viam-dev` -> Settings -> Look for the API key with named GITHUB_VIAM_MODULES.
